President Wesley K. Clark was reelected against former Vice President Dick Cheney in a stunning upset during countrywide pandemonium.\n<p>\nAlmost three years into his second term, Republicans hold both chambers of Congress and have built a labyrinth from here to the 2012 election. This effort is in hopes that Vice President Landrieu will fail to find her way to the castle and finally end this eight-year-running Democratic joke.</p> <p>Will Landrieu find her way to a term of her own or be consumed by the maze walls surrounding her perilous journey?\n",

That glory of the first female major party nominee was robbed because her face has remained at the edge of the frame for the last four years. Beyond the low enthusiasm for her candidacy also lies that she's a political bench warmer destined to fail so that the real political icon Hillary Clinton can take her seat on the throne in 4 years.\n<p>Ideologically, she's no more appealing than any other Democrat. She rarely makes thought-provoking speeches and refuses to stray too far from the standard party line since her first senate victory in the 90s. She doesn't even collect the scorn of the opposition; she's merely a face that the American people are indifferent toward. In a world where some religiously follow the incumbent president's word while others find everything he speaks revolting, she has made herself nobody's greatest enemy. But at the same time, it sucks to be nobody's favorite person.",
